# Anka VM Clone Builder

Type: `veertu-anka-vm-clone`

The `veertu-anka-vm-clone` Packer builder is able to clone existing Anka VM Templates for use with the [Anka Virtualization](https://veertu.com/technology/) package and the [Anka Build Cloud](https://veertu.com/anka-build/). The builder takes a source VM name, clones it, and then runs any provisioning necessary on the new VM Template before stopping or suspending it.

The builder does _not_ manage templates. Once a template is created, it is up
to you to use it or delete it.

This builder is part of the [Veertu Anka plugin](https://github.com/veertuinc/packer-plugin-veertu-anka). To install this plugin using `packer init`, add the following Packer block to your hcl template:

```hcl
packer {
  required_plugins {
    veertu-anka = {
      version = "= 3.2.0"
      source  = "github.com/veertuinc/veertu-anka"
    }
  }
}
```

## Important Notes

**In Anka 3.0** we now require a tagged source VM before cloning in order to share the underlying .ank image and optimize disk space. If your source VM is not tagged yet, we will assign one . **We highly recommend pushing this VM Template/Tag to your registry so [disk usage is optimized](https://docs.veertu.com/anka/apple/getting-started/creating-your-first-vm/#disk-optimization).**

## Configuration Reference

There are many configuration options available for the builder. They are segmented below into two categories: required and optional parameters.

#### _**Required Configuration**_

* `source_vm_name` (String) The VM to clone for provisioning, either stopped or suspended.

* `type` (String) Must be `veertu-anka-vm-clone`.

#### _**Optional Configuration**_

* `vm_name` (String) The name for the VM that is created.

  > Generated using the source_vm_name if not provided: (`{{ source_vm_name }}-{10RandomChars}`).

* `vcpu_count` (String) The number of vCPU cores, defaults to `2`.

* `ram_size` (String) The size in "[0-9]+G" format, defaults to `2G`.

* `disk_size` (String) The size in "[0-9]+G" format, defaults to `25G`.

  > We will automatically resize the internal disk for you by executing `diskutil apfs resizeContainer disk0s2 0` inside of the VM.

* `stop_vm` (Boolean) Whether or not to stop the vm after it has been created, defaults to false.

* `display_controller` (string) The display controller to set (run `anka modify VMNAME set display --help` to see available options).

* `always_fetch` (Boolean) Always pull the source VM from the registry. Defaults to false.

* `boot_delay` (String) The time to wait before running packer provisioner commands, defaults to `7s`.

* `cacert` (String) Path to a CA Root certificate.

* `cert` (String) Path to your node's client certificate to use for registry communication (if certificate authorization is enabled).

* `insecure` (Boolean) Skip TLS verification.

* `key` (String) Path to your node's client certificate key, if the `cert` certificate doesn't contain one, to use for registry communication (if certificate authorization is enabled).

* `hw_uuid` (String) (Anka 2 only) The Hardware UUID you wish to set (usually generated with `uuidgen`).

* `port_forwarding_rules` (Struct) 

  > If port forwarding rules are already set and you want to not have them fail the packer build, use `packer build --force`.
  
  * `port_forwarding_guest_port` (Int)
  * `port_forwarding_host_port` (Int)
  * `port_forwarding_rule_name` (String)

* `registry-path` (String) The registry URL (will use your default configuration if not set).

* `remote` (String) The registry name (will use your default configuration if not set).
  
  > This takes priority in Anka 3 and `registry-path` will be ignored.

* `source_vm_tag` (String) Specify the tag of the VM we want to clone instead of using the default.

* `update_addons` (Boolean) (Anka 2 only) Update the vm addons. Defaults to false.

* `use_anka_cp` (Boolean) Use built in anka cp command. Defaults to false.

## Example

Here is an example that uses the file and shell provisioners.

```hcl

variable "source_vm_name" {
  type = string
  default = "anka-packer-base-macos"
}

variable "vm_name" {
  type = string
  default = "anka-packer-from-source"
}

source "veertu-anka-vm-clone" "clone" {
  vm_name = "${var.vm_name}"
  source_vm_name = "${var.source_vm_name}"
}

build {
  sources = [
    "source.veertu-anka-vm-clone.clone",
  ]
  provisioner "file" {
    destination = "/private/tmp/"
    source      = "./examples/ansible"
  }
  provisioner "shell" {
    inline = [
      "[[ ! -d /tmp/ansible ]] && exit 100",
      "touch /tmp/ansible/test1"
    ]
  }
  provisioner "file" {
    destination = "./"
    direction   = "download"
    source      = "/private/tmp/ansible/test1"
  }
  provisioner "shell-local" {
    inline = [
      "[[ ! -f ./test1 ]] && exit 200",
      "rm -f ./test1"
    ]
  }
}

```
